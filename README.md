Georgina Rimmer - Tech Returners launchpad project - Exhibition Curation website

This project is hosted at: https://global-gallery.netlify.app/

OR to run the project locally on a device with a Ubuntu operating system:

1. You will need an integrated development environment (IDE) to be able to view the code. I recommend VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

2. In your IDE you need to open a terminal. In VSCode this is in the top menu Terminal > New Terminal. A box with cursor should appear.

3. The terminal displays the current folder path, you can use the command 'cd..' to navigate up the folder structure , 'ls' to view contents of the current folder, 'cd <foldername>' to navigate to a specific folder and 'mkdir <newfoldername>' to create a new folder.

4. Once you have chosen a folder for the project you can use the command 'git clone https://github.com/Georgie-x/launchpad-project.git' to copy the project repo to your device, 'cd launchpad-project' to navigate to the folder then 'code .' to open a new window with the code.

5. In a new terminal in the project window type 'npm i' to install the required software and 'npm run dev' which provides a link to open the project in the browser.
