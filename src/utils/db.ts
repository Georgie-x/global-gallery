      "description": "<p>This ancient storage vessel is decorated in the black-figure technique, which was developed in Corinth and used widely during the Archaic period (700–480 BCE). Gloss, a slip made from refined clay, was applied to all areas intended to be black. For the figural scene the silhouettes of the figures and other elements were painted in gloss, sometimes following the lines of a preliminary sketch scratched into the surface. Using a sharp tool, the artist created details by incising through the gloss to the light clay ground below. Colors such as purple-red and white, made from a gloss with mineral pigments, were then added. After a three-stage firing process applying alternately less and more oxygen, the gloss turned black. In its finest form, it was quite shiny.  On this vessel, those techniques are used by the artist to create lively scenes in which a woman dances playfully with a drape of fabric, perhaps her cloak. Male musicians accompany her with Greek instruments including a Barbiton (the string instrument which looks like a small harp) and an aulos (the wind instrument shaped like a doubled flute). The inquisitive dog adds to the sense of movement and rhythm within the scene.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>In the foreground of this tapestry based on the biblical story of Jacob and Esau, Rebecca advises her favorite son Jacob, clad in a star-adorned cloak, how to steal the birthright that belongs to his twin brother, Esau. The two young goats standing in the foreground were requested by Rebecca so she might cook a meal for Jacob to offer Isaac in exchange for the birthright. The scene in the right background shows the blind Isaac lying in bed and blessing the kneeling Jacob, having mistaken him for Esau. Rebecca stands nearby, holding a platter of goat meat. In the left background, Esau hunts with his dogs, unaware of the plot against him. All episodes shown are based on Genesis 27:2–29. The story of Jacob was a common subject for tapestry series; various <em>Jacob</em> suites were woven by Brussels and Flemish weavers in the 16th century.</p>\n",

Although at first glance its composition seems similar to the finished canvas, its 20 or more figures have little to do with the final version. The trio at right with an elderly seated figure, for example, was completely rethought in the completed work, where they are replaced by a man in a top hat and a woman walking a monkey on a leash. This ironic combination of grand solemnity and wry humor is totally absent from the sketch’s awkwardly positioned figures.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>During 1884 and 1885, Georges Seurat was hard at work on the most ambitious painting of his career, <em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em>, now a centerpiece of the Art Institute’s collection of 19th-century French painting. The artist’s genesis of this large canvas involved many preparatory studies, which fall primarily into two groups: small compositional sketches and color studies on wooden panels, and nuanced Conté crayon drawings that explore both the empty landscape and the shapes of specific figures or figural groups. In this contemplative drawing, Seurat developed the expressive contours of the seated female figure holding a parasol that would ultimately occupy the center of the finished painting.</p>\n",
