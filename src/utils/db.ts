		description:
			"<p>In the foreground of this tapestry based on the biblical story of Jacob and Esau, Rebecca advises her favorite son Jacob, clad in a star-adorned cloak, how to steal the birthright that belongs to his twin brother, Esau. The two young goats standing in the foreground were requested by Rebecca so she might cook a meal for Jacob to offer Isaac in exchange for the birthright. The scene in the right background shows the blind Isaac lying in bed and blessing the kneeling Jacob, having mistaken him for Esau. Rebecca stands nearby, holding a platter of goat meat. In the left background, Esau hunts with his dogs, unaware of the plot against him. All episodes shown are based on Genesis 27:2–29. The story of Jacob was a common subject for tapestry series; various <em>Jacob</em> suites were woven by Brussels and Flemish weavers in the 16th century.</p>\n",

			'<p>This small oil on thin wood panel is one of over 20 painted studies Georges Seurat made for <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27992/a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte-1884"><em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884</em></a> . Although at first glance its composition seems similar to the finished canvas, its 20 or more figures have little to do with the final version. The trio at right with an elderly seated figure, for example, was completely rethought in the completed work, where they are replaced by a man in a top hat and a woman walking a monkey on a leash. This ironic combination of grand solemnity and wry humor is totally absent from the sketch’s awkwardly positioned figures.</p>\n',
